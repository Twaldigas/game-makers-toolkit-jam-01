# Sword Combo Rush


Sword Combo Rush  is my second video game. Your character was put into a world and have to fight against monsters and the time. Reach the ending of each level in time to win. If the time runs out, your combos can save you!

I used the Game Maker's Toolkit Jam as an opportunity to develop my second video game. I used all the epxerience I got from developing my very first game and tried new stuff like enemies, combat and combos.

The game was developed with the Godot Engine. Sounds was made with [Bfxr](http://www.bfxr.net/).
